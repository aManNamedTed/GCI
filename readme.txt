Description: A 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes' inspired cooperative game; Good Cop/Intern is the exciting new game where you interrogate people of the validity of their story! One person, the Intern, gets to interrogate, yet they do not know what they're doing! The other person, the Good Cop, possesses a comprehensive list of actions and phrases that correlate to how they should be responded to. The interrogate-ee starts with their story, and the Intern must provide the story to the Good Cop to which they will try--with their best effort--to feed the Intern the correct response to get correct response. At the end of a predetermined time limit, the Intern must decide whether the interogate-ee is innocent, or guilty! Side-note: Who the hell gives the intern THAT much power?!
